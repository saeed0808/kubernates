Kubernates networking addresses four concerns:-

- Container within a pod use networking to communicate via loopback.
- Cluster Networking provides Comminication between different pods.
- The service resources lets you expose an application running in pods to be rechable from outside your cluster.
- you can also use services to publish services only for consumption inside your cluster
- container to container communication on same pod happens through localhost within the containers.
